I love the website http://www.vegetariantimes.com/, it's got great recipes.

Its print stylesheet, I do not love.

This is a Chrome plugin I made to fix it so I can print more recipes with less ink in a more readable way.

# Installation

Google [no longer allows you to install from any website](http://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2664769&p=crx_warning) so you will need to download the most recent CRX, open your extensions page, and drag it in to install.

Lame, I know. But I don't want to deal with the Google Chrome store.
